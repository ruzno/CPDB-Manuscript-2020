This project refers to the analysis of the climatepolicydatabase.org data used in the 
publication 'Twenty years of climate policy: G20 coverage increased, but important gaps remain.'

The database ('DatabaseFinal.csv') used in the manuscript is found in the folder *data*.

In the same folder we add country data ('Countries.csv'), including GHG emissions and population for the
countries analysed in the paper.

The code used to map the policy instruments ('PolicyInstruments.csv'), sectors and mitigation areas to the 
policy options is in the file 'Code.csv.'

The main scripts are found in the root folder:

 - DataPreparation.py prepares the data for the analysis, including general cleaning and filters.
 - Analysis.py contains the code necessary to generate the data for Figure 2 in the manuscript.
