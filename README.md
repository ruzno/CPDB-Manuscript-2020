This project refers to the analysis of the climatepolicydatabase.org data used in the 
publication 'Twenty years of climate policy: G20 coverage increased, but important gaps remain.'

The database ('source_database_23_06_2021.csv') used in the manuscript is in the folder *data*.

In the same folder we add country data, including GHG emissions countries analysed in the paper.

The main scripts are in the root folder:

 - PolicyData.py prepares the data for the analysis, including general cleaning and filters.
 - stats.py contains general analysis of sectors and policy instruments.
 
 For more details on the definition of policies, policy instruments and other terminology please refer 
 to the supplementary material of the manuscript (DOI:XXXXXXXXX) or contact the author at:
